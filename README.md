# JacksonScript

What if there was a super simple language for beginners without all the WTF of JavaScript?

## Rules? Yes it does.

* No `undefined`
* No `new`
* No `prototype`
* Block scoped variables (let)
* No named functions
* Ergo no variable or function hoisting
* Double equals works as triple equals
* Inner function `this` bound correctly
* No NaN

## Goals? Yes it has.

* Compile to JavaScript
* Be JavaScript the best parts
* Do not be WTF
